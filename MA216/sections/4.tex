\begin{statebox}{}{question-1}
    Why is the denominator $M-1$ instead of $M$?
    \[
    	\sigma_M^2 := \frac{1}{M-1}\sum_{i=1}^{M} (\epsilon_i-\mu_M)^2
    \]
\end{statebox}



\section{Question 2}
\begin{statebox}{}{question-2}
    Try both cases in computer simulations and what is your observation?
\end{statebox}



\section{Question 3}
\begin{statebox}{}{question-3}
    Prove that the $M-1$ case is better in the statistical sense.
