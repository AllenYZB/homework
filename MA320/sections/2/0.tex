\begin{abstract}
	We introduce the geometric progression through an ancient story called \emph{The rice and the chessboard}, then we give a proper and accurate definition of geometric progression, from which we derive the summation formula for the geometric progression in both finite and infinite cases. Furthermore, we list some useful applications of the geometric progression and implement them in \texttt{Python}.
