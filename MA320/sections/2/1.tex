\subsection{Definition}
\begin{theobox}{Geometric Progression\cite{Weisstein2019gp}}{gp}
    A geometric sequence is a sequence $\{a_k\}, k=0, 1, \ldots$, such that each term is given by a multiple $r$ of the previous one. Another equivalent definition is that a sequence is geometric iff\footnote{if and only if} it has a zero series bias. If the multiplier is $r$, then the $k$th term is given by
    \[
        a_k = ra_{k-1} = r^2a_{k-2} = \cdots = a_0r^k.
    \]

    Taking $a_0=1$ gives the simple special case
    \[
        a_k = r^k.
    \]

\begin{theobox}{Arithmetic Progression\cite{Weisstein2019ap}}{ap}
    An arithmetic progression, also known as an arithmetic sequence, is a sequence of $n$ numbers $\{a_0+kd\}^{n-1}_{k=0}$ such that the differences between successive terms is a constant $d$.
